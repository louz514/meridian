// One global mutex serializing every operation that signs with the house wallet:
// the LP guard's 5-min tick, the operator's lp-open / lp-close / index-trade
// endpoints, and (if ever enabled) the agent loop's execution. Without it two
// paths could either submit txs concurrently on the same nonce (collision /
// silent replacement) OR interleave a multi-step op — a retile's
// withdraw -> swap -> mint — with an outside swap that shifts the balances
// mid-flight, so the mint prices against a wallet that changed under it.
//
// Operation-level, NOT per-send: each entry point wraps its WHOLE operation.
// The correctness rule is that a locked operation must never itself call another
// locked entry point — a nested acquire would chain behind the op that is
// awaiting it and deadlock forever, freezing all wallet activity. Rather than
// trust that invariant silently, an AsyncLocalStorage flag detects re-entry and
// throws immediately (fail loud, not hang). FIFO ordering via a promise chain; a
// rejection never breaks the chain (the next waiter still runs).
